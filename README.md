# ðŸŽ­ Face Generation with DCGANs

This project implements a **Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN)** in TensorFlow/Keras to generate realistic human face images using the **CelebA dataset**. It follows the standard GAN pipeline with a custom training loop and visualizes how the generator improves over training epochs.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
- **Goal:** Train a GAN that learns the distribution of celebrity face images and generates new, fake faces that resemble real ones.  
- **Approach:**  
  - **Generator**: Transposed convolutions with BatchNorm and ReLU activations.  
  - **Discriminator**: Convolutions with LeakyReLU activations to classify real vs fake.  
  - **Training loop**: Implemented via a subclassed `tf.keras.Model`, with separate optimizers for D and G.  
  - **Tricks used:** Label smoothing, label noise, and balanced training steps to stabilize GAN learning.  
- **Visualization:** A callback generates and saves 6Ã—6 image grids after each epoch to monitor progress.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Loads and preprocesses **CelebA dataset** automatically from Kaggle.  
- Custom **GAN training loop** with `train_step`.  
- Includes **label smoothing + noise** to reduce discriminator overconfidence.  
- Uses **`tanh` normalization** for stable generator outputs.  
- Saves generated face grids to a `generated/` folder at each epoch.
