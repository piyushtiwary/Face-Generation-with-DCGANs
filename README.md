# Face-Generation-with-DCGANs
This project implements a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) in TensorFlow/Keras to generate realistic human face images using the CelebA dataset. It follows the standard GAN pipeline with a custom training loop and visualizes how the generator improves over training epochs.
